# Dev Test 4

## Scenario
You have an angularjs application that allows adding tasks to a task list.  
A couple of bugs were found during testing.  
* The text box needs to gain focus when the app starts and after a new item is added.
* We should not allow blank entries to be added to the task list.

## Your Task
In your pull request
* Fix the two bugs found above.

## Constraints
* Do not use any additional libraries (no additional nuget packages).
